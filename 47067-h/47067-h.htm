</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_9 c005'     >More than a century and a quarter
ago there was fired in Concord,
Mass., a shot that was heard
around the world. This shot terminated
the domination of monopoly and
marked the opening of a new era,—the
building of a new empire.</p>

<p class='c006' >Not less important to all lovers of
turkeys is the shot fired in this same
beautiful old town by Margaret Mahaney,
when she first put an end to the
bogy that has been hovering over the
Turkey industry so long, i.&nbsp;e., <em>Blackhead</em>.
Not less triumphant has been
her conquest of practically all the ailments
besetting this beautiful bird.</p>

<p class='c006' ><a name='Page_iv' id='Page_iv'></a>It is really beyond belief that Miss
Mahaney has raised in a season 300
turkeys with a loss of less than 2 per
cent, when for years the Experiment
Stations and Agricultural Colleges, as
well as nearly all poultrymen, have
claimed that turkeys could not be raised
in this State. All would recognize this
as wonderful work if applied to chickens,
but when accomplished with turkeys
it is doubly wonderful. These
same Experiment Station directors had
told Miss Mahaney that she could not
do the things she was already accomplishing,
but when they visited her
farm they held up their hands and departed,
acknowledging that here was a
woman who had performed the miracle.</p>

<p>MISS MAHANEY’S $150.00 PRIZE TOM</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006' >Miss Mahaney was a wonderfully
capable trained nurse who broke down
at her work and was ordered to the
country to save her life, urged particularly
<a name='Page_v' id='Page_v'></a>to take up some out-of-door work.
Poultry keeping appealed to her from
the first, but turkeys particularly for
the reason of the difficulties to be surmounted.
If she could do what others
could not she would be satisfied. Anyone
could raise chickens, but hardly
anyone could raise turkeys. Here was
a task that delighted her and a problem
that appealed to her. The difficulties
she encountered would have discouraged
any one but a pioneer of her
character. Her deep maternal instinct
(and she is, figuratively speaking,
mother to everything and everybody
upon the beautiful estate where she
lives) brought the babies and old turkeys
through their blackhead troubles,
and from her medical training, together
with the aid she received from
contact with members of her family
who were physicians, she recognized
<a name='Page_vi' id='Page_vi'></a>symptoms and remedies which one
could acknowledge as miracles and not
overstep the truth. She has applied
the fruits of her life work to the solving
of a problem, and some day the
country at large from Maine to California
will raise its hat to Margaret
Mahaney, the lady from Concord,
Mass., who restored what was supposed
to be lost:—the art of raising turkeys,—and
that in confinement in poultry
houses under practically the same conditions
as chickens.</p>

<p class='c006' >If you find time to go to Concord, by
all means call on Miss Mahaney and
she will make you welcome. She will
show you more turkeys than have ever
before been raised in one flock in the
eastern states, and she will delight in
telling you the simple methods she
<a name='Page_vii' id='Page_vii'></a>uses. On the following pages she will
tell you in her own way how she accomplishes
it.</p>

<p class='c006' >We repeat, Miss Mahaney is a wonderful
woman. She has a beautiful
estate on which to produce these birds,
but others are doing just as wonderful
work with them by following her teachings.</p>

<p class='c012' >My dear Readers:—</p>

<p class='c006' >The following is a copy of a letter
recently received by me, and which represents
the type of communications I
have received daily for over three years
from all parts of the country:</p>

<p class='c013' >My dear Miss Mahaney:—</p>

<p class='c014' >Altho we are strangers to
each other, I am writing you
today, regarding turkey raising.
I read some time ago in
the “Boston Post” that you had
good success in raising turkeys,
so I take the liberty of writing
you for instructions, if you will
kindly give them to me. I have
<a name='Page_4' id='Page_4'></a>tried for several years to raise
a few, but it has been a hard
job. They would do well for
about six or seven weeks, then
grow sick with liver and bowel
trouble and fade away. Now
what is the trouble? What
must they be fed with? Must
they range or be kept in a yard?
In fact, what way must I manage
to raise turkeys? What is
your experience? Please write
me.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c015'   >
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sincerely,</div>
      <div class='line in10'>etc.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014' >It is in answer to such letters as the
foregoing that I am placing my methods
in book form on the market, in
order to enlighten the breeders of turkeys
and to inform them how I first
succeeded where others have failed.</p>

<p class='c014' >In the first place, I visited two or
three farms in the country. I found
that no care whatever was taken of the
<a name='Page_5' id='Page_5'></a>turkeys. A common hen was fairly
well looked after, fed and kept warm.
The turkey was supposed to forage for
itself, roost on old wagons or any sort
of roost that the bird found convenient,
at night and in all kinds of weather.
Conditions were anything but sanitary.
Inbreeding was permitted year after
year, as one tom was thought sufficient
for the hen turkeys of five or six neighbors.</p>

<p class='c014' >I visited one farm in particular,
which had on it turkeys from very
nice stock, about twenty in all. Of
course they were small and pale, and
had not developed as they should have.
They roosted in a sort of shed right off
the barn cellar, so that they had access
to the barn cellar, and they roamed
around on the manure pile all day.
The manure was turned down through
an opening under the cows. The roof
<a name='Page_6' id='Page_6'></a>of that shed had no shingles on it, and
in wet weather the rain simply poured
down on those birds. It is only natural
that conditions such as these will bring
on roup and all kinds of diseases. The
birds will not be developed and cannot
possibly be strong enough when the
spring comes to fulfill the duties of the
breeding season.</p>

<p class='c014' >Birds hatched amid such surroundings
are tainted with roup and other
afflictions.</p>

<p class='c014' >It is not very long ago since I had
a talk with a gentleman from Vermont.
He told me that at one time Vermont
made a large amount of money in turkey
raising. When the turkeys got to
be four or five weeks old, the raisers
simply turned them out, and let them
take care of themselves. Those that
lived through the summer, weathered
storms and all other sorts of hardships,
<a name='Page_7' id='Page_7'></a>they rounded up in the fall, fattened
for market or sold for breeders. This
was what they called “clear profit.”
Everyone can readily understand to
what that “clear profit” has led.</p>

<p class='c014' >The result is that our splendid bronze
turkeys are dying out by the thousands
each year, and within seven or eight
more years, if something is not done to
strengthen the turkey and keep it up
to the standard of at least the common
hen, our famous turkey of America will
be a thing of the past. Whereas, if the
turkey when hatched is given good feed
as described in another part of my book,
taken care of until the red is thrown,
and then turned into a good, warm shed
at night, kept dry and warm in damp
weather, and fed reasonably, three-thirds
of the trouble in raising turkeys
can be avoided.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_8' id='Page_8'></a>Care must be given to the breeding
hens. They must be kept in sanitary
quarters, given plenty of good feed,
with four drops of tincture of iron to
a gallon of water, plenty of lime and
sand, about half and half, and left
where they can eat it at their own
convenience. If you give ground bone,
have it very fine, for it is apt to lodge
in the corner of the mouth and sometimes
will cause ulceration. When this
happens, the jowl of the bird will become
swollen, and on close examination,
there will be found a small piece
of white bone which will have to be
removed and the mouth washed with
sulpho-napthol or Presto Disinfectant.
I generally use my salve two or three
times before the wound is healed. If
the bird that lays the eggs is good and
strong, the turkeys that are hatched
<a name='Page_9' id='Page_9'></a>will be strong and rugged, and to “<em>keep
them growing from the start</em>” has always
been my motto.</p>

<p class='c014' >In my closing paragraph I wish to
say to all my readers that I have been
most sincere and straightforward in
everything that I have written in this
book. To one and all who may read
this, I extend a cordial invitation to
visit my turkey farm in Concord, Massachusetts,
that you may see for yourselves
the progress I have made in the
last eight years in raising turkeys in
yards under the same conditions as
chickens, a feat which has been claimed
heretofore by experiment stations to
be impossible to accomplish, in poultry-congested
New England.</p>

<p class='c014' >I have labored with the problem of
turkey raising for many years, and
sincerely believe myself to be in a position
to advise others who may be beginners,
<a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'></a>as I once was, concerning the
difficulties of turkey raising, and the
best method of overcoming them.</p>

  <h2 id='fa2' class='c004'>FACTS ABOUT TURKEY RAISING</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c016'     >The one great essential on the
part of a person raising or attempting
to raise turkeys is patience,
or persistency, whichever you care to
call it. To anyone thinking of starting
in this work I can only say that
you will meet with plenty of difficulties
and much that will discourage and dishearten
you, but when you remember
that each failure or discouragement
means just that much more added to
your knowledge of, and experience in
this work, it should give you heart to
keep on, and if you do keep on and on,
using each little bit of experience thus
gained and using it to good effect, in
the end success is bound to come. I
<a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'></a>am going to tell you a few of the discouraging
things that happened to me,
and also of my method of raising turkeys,
a method based on long experience
and perfected in the face of many
discouragements, and I hope that in the
telling, you may learn something that
will be of benefit.</p>

<p class='c014' >I started with twelve turkey eggs.
Had I known then how hard they are
to raise, I wonder if I would have attempted
it? I hatched out eight turkeys
from that lot of eggs, and I raised
just one. I named her Hen-Hen, and
she is on my place today, and is at the
head of all my flock.</p>

<p class='c014' >The following year I hatched out
over thirty turkeys, and only succeeded
in raising four. My work was then
carried on on low land. The next year,
I put old Hen-Hen on higher ground,
where I am raising all my flock today.
<a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'></a>She hatched out fifteen turkeys, and I
raised all but one. I killed off some of
the young toms, and kept all the pullets,
all of which I still have, and they
are splendid, strong stock, short-legged,
heavy and a splendid bronze.</p>

<p class='c014' >I then sent to Kentucky and brought
out some of the best stock I could find
down there, and then began my battle
to raise turkeys. I had very good success,
that is, as far as I went. At
first, I knew hardly anything about the
proper way to feed, and the right food
to give my turkeys, but as the years
went by, my experience in feeding
taught me a great deal.</p>

<h3 id='br3' class='c017'>BREEDING</h3>

<p class='c014' >Now I will tell you in as concise a
way as possible, the method I consider
proper in raising turkeys. In the first
place, it is necessary to have a good,
<a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'></a>strong two-year-old hen to breed from
with a tom that is no relation whatever
to the family. One of the foremost
things you must be particular <em>not</em> to do
is to inbreed. I much prefer a common
hen to put my first hatch of eggs
under; that will give the turkey hens
a much longer time to lay. I consider
it better to put my <em>turkey</em> hens on my
June eggs. I put fifteen eggs under a
turkey hen, and eleven under a common
hen.</p>

<p class='c014' >When the little turkeys come out, I
disinfect their heads and under the
wings with my own salve. Have you
ever seen a little turkey that has a
cold in its head wipe its beak under
its wing? I have many times found
the feathers under their wings matted
as a result of this ill-bred habit
of theirs. That, of course, is not a
healthy state for a young bird that is
<a name='Page_17' id='Page_17'></a>growing, and that is the reason that I
disinfect with my salve under their
wings and on their heads, and they
always seem brighter afterward.</p>

<div id='f017' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>
<img src='images/facing017.jpg' alt='' class='ig003' />
<p>SHOWING STYLE OF RUNS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014' >I have good, strong runs, 5 feet long
and 4 feet wide, with high coops and
thorough ventilation from the top,
which carries off all the impure and
overheated air, and keeps the temperature
normal at the bottom of the coops
for the little turkeys. On hot days I
cover my runs with burlap.</p>

<p class='c014' >The turkeys must be kept clean and
dry and their straw must be well aired
every day. Once a week, I wash out
the bottom of the coop with disinfectant,
and put in clean straw.</p>

<p class='c014' >I give them all the lettuce they can
eat three times daily, as the secret of
raising turkeys is to keep their bowels
in good order, and the droppings a
bright green. Just as soon as I see a
<a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'></a>little turkey with its wings drooping,
I take it away from the others and
treat it as described on page <a href='#Page_82'>82</a>.</p>

<p class='c014' >I have invented my own pills for the
cure of blackhead and they are now
being largely used by turkey raisers
all through New England.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014' >When my little turkeys are about
three or four days old, I give them
<i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i> Turkey Feed, and
a little skimmed milk with a good solid
feed of lettuce—all they can eat. At
noon, I feed them lettuce again and
clean water containing tincture of iron,
4 drops to each gallon of water. At
night, I feed them bread soaked in milk
and lettuce cut up fine with an onion
and a shake of red pepper. After
<a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'></a>having dry feed all day, they relish the
soft feed at night. There is no reason
why, if you use my method in raising
turkeys, and have your runs on high
ground, you cannot be successful.</p>

<p class='c014' >If the turkeys are raised in the right
way, they are no harder to raise than
chickens. When the pullets are about
four months old, they should be given
epsom salts twice a week (a small teaspoonful
to a gallon of water). This
keeps the turkey in good condition and
the blood cool. Also a tablespoonful
of sulphate of iron in a pail of water
should be left in some place where they
can drink it. Keep them good and dry
until they are ready for shipment, for
turkeys are subject to blackhead until
they are one year old.</p>

<p class='c014' >I will be only too glad to give any
information in my power to people who
are interested in this subject. While
<a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'></a>the Experimental Colleges have put out
some bulletins on the care of turkeys,
the person that is going to issue a report
on the raising of turkeys must get
out in the field and be with them from
the time they are baby chicks until they
are ready to be disposed of, and then it
will be many years before he will know
all there is to know about turkey raising.
I have spent years on my turkeys,
and I think that I am now in a
position to give any information that
any grower may require in regard to
this matter.</p>

<p>THE MAHANEY SYSTEM DEVELOPS STRONG, HARDY BIRDS</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'></a>
  <h2 id='bo2' class='c004'>BRIEF OUTLINE OF MY METHOD OF RAISING TURKEYS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_9 c016'     >In the first place I select a good quiet
hen that has been setting two or
three days and put her in a deep, warm
nest, not too far from the top of the
box, so that when she goes to feed, the
hen will not break the eggs by jumping
on them when she returns to the nest.
Twelve eggs seems a great number of
turkey eggs to put under one hen, but
that is what I put under every common
hen, and I sometimes hatch out all the
eggs. I spray the nests well with sulphur
and also use my salve on the hen
up until the sixteenth day. I never put
any disinfectant on the hen or on her
nest after that because there is life inside
<a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'></a>the eggs by that time, and the disinfectant
is very apt to kill it.</p>

<p class='c014' >When the eggs begin to hatch, some
will hatch out before the rest; these I
take away, placing them in a good
warm box wrapped in flannel and keep
them good and warm until all the eggs
are hatched out and the mother able to
receive them. When they are two days
old, I put the young turkeys in a good
clean coop, well whitewashed and waterproof.
My runs are 5 ft. long and
4 ft. wide. I shut my little birds up
in the coop for the first four days, until
they become good and strong. After
that, if the weather is fine and warm,
I let them out about ten o’clock and put
them in about three o’clock.</p>

<p class='c014' >Their first food consists of a hard
boiled egg, a shake of red pepper and
three parts dandelion, cut up fine. You
can give them all the green food they
<a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'></a>will eat, and also powdered charcoal
and fine grit. After they are 3 or 4
days old, I give them bread and milk
squeezed dry, and the <i>Margaret Mahaney</i>
Turkey Feed.</p>

<p class='c014' >The young poults are kept in runs
which should be moved to a new spot
each day and care taken that they are
kept clean, dry and warm, and the
straw must be taken out of the coops
and thoroughly aired and kept good
and clean, as the sanitary condition
is half the battle in raising turkeys.
Place your runs on a side hill, facing
the south. On hot days, cover the runs
with burlap.</p>

<p class='c014' >Let them out into the runs for two
hours or more every afternoon that is
pleasant and dry until the time the
birds are nine weeks old. Do not let
them out in damp weather before they
are two years old, for they are very
<a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'></a>susceptible to dampness and should be
kept housed and warm in rainy and
damp weather. While the little birds
are out, watch carefully for hawks and
pests.</p>

<p class='c014' >Give the turkeys all the milk you can
afford to give, as this will keep them
growing. Plant a good field of lettuce
and give them all this vegetable they
can eat, and you will find that they will
eat lettuce three times a day with good
relish.</p>

<p class='c014' >One of the secrets of raising turkeys
is to keep the droppings a bright green;
that, of course, keeps the liver in good
condition, and goes a long way in keeping
blackhead out of the flock. Take
some lime, slack it, put half sand with
it and make a sort of soft mush out of
it. Place this on a board and dry it;
then crumble it up and leave it around
where your little turkeys can get it to
eat.</p>

<div id='f026' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic005'>
<img src='images/facing026.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' />
<p>“GIVE THE TURKEYS ALL THE MILK YOU CAN”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_27' id='Page_27'></a>Keep them in dry, tight houses with
the south side open so that they may
have an abundance of fresh air without
draughts.</p>

<p class='c014' >When it is time to let them out of
the runs, you can let them out for three
and four hours at a time; you will find
that they will want to go back to the
runs when they become tired. Do not
give them much feed at night; give
them plenty of time to digest everything
in their bowels, and they will then
be ready for a good morning meal.</p>

<h3 id='th3' class='c017'>THROWING THE RED</h3>

<p class='c014' >When they show signs of throwing
the red, put four drops of tincture of
iron to a gallon of drinking water three
or four times a week. If it is cold,
rainy weather, put a drop of aconite
in the water every day while the wet
weather lasts. This will prevent their
<a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'></a>taking cold, and, as cold is the first sign
of blackhead and diarrhea, it can be
easily seen that a little precaution is
worth more than a pound of cure.</p>

<p class='c014' >In regard to keeping lice off the little
turkeys—you must disinfect your hens
and the turkeys very frequently. My
salve for that purpose is a convenient
and effective remedy.</p>

<p class='c014' >If you will do as I have instructed

<h3 id='se3' class='c017'>SELECTION AND TREATMENT OF BREEDING STOCK</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c019'     >There are some rules that must
be followed in the selection of turkeys
for breeding if it is hoped to succeed.
Careless indifference has given
no end of trouble to turkey raisers. In
some instances which the writer has
investigated all the turkeys owned in
one locality have descended from the
one original bird purchased many years
before! In one case it was said that
for twenty years no new blood had come
into the neighborhood. If this foolish
procedure had been continued it would
have resulted in the destruction of the
constitutional vigor of the turkeys.</p>

<div>
  <a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'></a>
<h3 id='ru3' class='c017'>RULES FOR THE SELECTION OF STOCK</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014' >A few plain rules which may be observed
to advantage are as follows:</p>

<p class='c014' >1. Always use as breeders turkey
hens over one year old. Be sure that
they are strong, healthy and vigorous,
of good medium size. In no instance
select the smaller ones but do not strive
to have them unusually large.</p>

<p class='c014' >2. The male may be a yearling
or older. Do not imagine that the
large, overgrown males are the best.
Strength, health and vigor with a well
proportioned medium size are the main
points of excellence.</p>

<p class='c014' >3. Avoid close breeding. New blood
is of vital importance to turkeys. Better
send a thousand miles for a new
male than risk the chance of inbreeding.
Secure one in the fall so as to be assured
of his healthy and vigorous constitution
prior to the breeding season.</p>

<div>
  <a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'></a>
<h3 id='ki3' class='c017'>KIND OF HENS TO SELECT</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014' >No matter what variety of turkey
may be selected for keeping, they
should, above all things, be strong, vigorous,
healthy and well matured, but
not akin. Better secure the females
from one locality and the male from another
to insure their non-relationship
rather than run the risk of inbreeding.
In all fowls it is well to remember that
size is influenced largely by the female
and color and finish by the male. Securing
an over-large male to mate with
small, weakly hens is not wise policy.
A medium size male with a good size female
of good constitutional vigor and
mature age will do far better than the
largest male bird with the smallest
females.</p>

<p class='c014' >The wise farmer always selects the
very best corn or grain of all kinds for
seeds. Equal care should be given the
<a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'></a>selection of the breeding stock in turkeys.
The best raised on the farm
should be reserved for producers and
the fact should be kept in mind that turkey
hens of the best quality after their
second and third year make the best
producers. Keep your best young hens
with this in view. Undersized hens
that lack constitutional vigor are not
the kinds to select for successful turkey
breeding. When you stop to consider
that the male turkey is half of the entire
flock in the matter of breeding, we
may be led to greater care in the selection.
None can be too good for the purpose.
Constitutional vigor is of the
first importance. Without this he can
have no value whatever for the purpose
intended. Plenty of bone, a full round
breast and a long body are important.
No matter of what stock or breeding the
hen may be, the male should be selected
<a name='Page_35' id='Page_35'></a>from one of the standard varieties. If
the hens are of the same standard variety
the male of the same variety
should be selected so as to maintain the
stock in its purity. Well selected individuals
of some one of the several
standard varieties will give better results
than can be secured by cross
breeding, which has a tendency to bring
to the surface the weak points of both
sides of the cross. Proper crosses may
improve the first issue but if followed
up they rarely prove successful.</p>

<h3 id='nu3' class='c017'>NUMBER OF FEMALES TO ONE MALE</h3>

<p class='c014' >The best rule for mating is to confine
in yards, using eight or nine females
to one male; some say twelve, but all I
ever mate to one tom is eight females.
The result of this number is that all
my eggs prove fertile.</p>

<p class='c014' >When they are yarded and from
<a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'></a>eight to ten females are kept, it is better
to have two toms and keep one shut
up while the other is with the hens,
changing them at least twice a week.
When they run at large on a farm they
will naturally divide into flocks. Under
such conditions use one male to no
more than six females.</p>

<h3 id='ca3' class='c017'>CARE TO BE GIVEN BREEDING STOCK</h3>

<p class='c014' >March and April are the two months
of the year that the breeding hen should
have particular care. In the first
place, I keep them warm and comfortable,
with a box of sand where they can
dust themselves every day. There is
no bird that takes such pleasure in
dusting herself as the turkey. She
will roll on the sand for hours at a time
in the sun, and this makes her happy
and contented.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'></a>At this time I feed plenty of <i>Margaret
Mahaney’s</i> Turkey Feed with Oyster
Shells always within reach and a mixture
of wheat, oats, barley, a very little
cracked corn and beef scraps fed three
or four times a week. Give plenty of
drinking water and three or four times
a week put a drop or two of tincture
of iron to a gallon of drinking water.
This keeps the bird healthy and strong.
Take half lime and half sand, make a
mush of it and spread it on a board to
dry. When it is hard, place it in a box
and leave it where your turkey hen
can get it to eat at her own convenience.
That helps to mature the eggs. She is
very tender at this time. All through
the laying season she must be kept
warm and comfortable. It all goes towards
making a successful season of
turkey raising.</p>

<div>
  <a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'></a>
<h3 id='ma3' class='c017'>MATING</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014' >March is the proper time to mate up
your pens of turkeys. I put one tom
in a pen with eight hens. I watch my
turkey hens very closely to see that they
are not injured in any way by the spurs
of the tom. If the turkey hen goes
around with one wing down, you will
know that she has been hurt, and if you
take her up you will probably find that
her side has been torn by the tom.
Wash her carefully with a disinfectant,
and if the wound needs a stitch it had
better be taken as it will heal quicker.</p>

<h3 id='fe3' class='c017'>FEEDING DURING BREEDING SEASON</h3>

<p class='c014' >In February and March do not feed
your turkey hens too rich food or too
many beef scraps or food of any kind
that will force the hens to lay too early.
You do not want any young chicks
hatched out before the first of May or
<a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'></a>the last of April. When my turkey
hens start to lay I feed a ground feed
that is put up under my formula by
The Park &amp; Pollard Company of Boston,
Mass., which they are putting out
under the name of <i>Margaret Mahaney’s
Turkey Feed</i>, and which can be procured
of them all ready for feeding.
Have plenty of beef scraps and oyster
shells within easy reach. Twice a week
put tincture of iron in the drinking
water, four drops to a gallon of water;
allow one gallon of water to each pen.
The tincture of iron keeps the birds
strong and in good condition, as a young
turkey hen is very apt to weaken after
her first litter of eggs is laid. Sometimes
they die if not properly cared for.</p>

<p class='c014' >Keep on hand within easy reach, constantly,
a mixture of half sand and half
lime made into a soft mush. When
dry crumble up and leave it where your
<a name='Page_40' id='Page_40'></a>turkeys can get it to eat. They will
eat this ravenously and it helps to
harden the shells of the eggs.</p>

<h3 id='ne3' class='c017'>NESTS AND NESTING.</h3>

<p class='c014' >When the turkey hen is ready to lay
she will start in first by looking in all
the corners, for if she is yarded up, it
is her nature to look for a dark and secluded
spot in which to lay. I place
to eight turkey hens four good dark
nests. I make these by using packing
cases with the cover on and the opening
turned towards the wall of the house,
allowing just enough room for the bird
to enter. I put good, clean hay in the
box. The turkey hen will be very
happy when she finds that nobody can
see her in her nest. It will make her
very contented, and as we are now
breeding turkeys in the domestic state,
almost the same as the common hen,
<a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'></a>why not give them just the same care?
You will find in the long run that you
will raise many more turkeys if a turkey
hen is properly housed and kept
warm during the cold months of winter.
The turkey hen begins to grow
her eggs three months before she begins
to lay, and as we all know that the turkey
is a very cold bird, it is only natural
that she should be kept warm.
My houses are comfortable, tight and
dry, but well ventilated from the south
side.</p>

<p class='c014' >When the turkey hen has laid about
eighteen or nineteen eggs she will show
signs of wanting to sit. Very quietly
take her off the nest, remove her to another
coop, give her a good range to run
in with plenty of <i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i>
Turkey Feed. In the meantime set the
eggs under two good common hens. I
find that Plymouth Rocks make good
<a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'></a>mothers. I put eleven or twelve eggs
under a good Plymouth Rock hen, and
make a good round nest in a half bushel
box, stuffing the corners well so that the
nest will stay in shape, as a good nest is
half the hatching. In the meantime the
turkey hen having had her run has forgotten
all about sitting, and has started
to laying again and I put her back in
the mating pen. This process can be
repeated three times during the season
as a turkey hen will lay three litters in
succession. I let my turkey hens sit
on my June eggs and these hatch about
the tenth or eleventh of July. These
make good hardy birds for the coming
cold weather. Disinfect the hen with
<i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i> Salve, per directions,
before setting on the eggs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<h3 id='ha3' class='c017'>HATCHING</h3>

<p class='c014' >To go back to the hatching of the
turkeys; the eggs that are right under
<a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'></a>the breast of the hen will hatch first.
Sometimes I do not wait for them all to
come out of the shell, taking them away,
say four or five at a time, thus giving
the outside eggs a chance to hatch.
The eggs which I take away I put in an
incubator which has previously been
regulated to the right heat. When they
are all hatched, I have my coop well
whitewashed and about six inches of
good clean straw on the bottom. I place
my biddy in the coop and put the little
turkeys all around her. Be very careful
in giving them drink or water that
the little turkeys do not get wet, for
they often take cold in that way.</p>

<h3 id='fi3' class='c017'>FIRST FEED</h3>

<p class='c014' >The first feed that I give them is common
sting nettle, chopped fine, with a
hard boiled egg and a little shake of red
pepper. You will find that they will
<a name='Page_44' id='Page_44'></a>eat the green stuff ravenously, and this
acts on the bowels as a regular physic.</p>

<p class='c014' >When they are three days old I begin
feeding them the prepared ground feed,—<i>Margaret
Mahaney’s</i> Turkey Feed—with
a little wheat bread soaked in milk,
squeezed dry and mixed with the egg
and nettle. As the Park &amp; Pollard
Company carry this ground feed it can
be easily had there. I keep this always
before them. In the morning I give
them nothing but the <i>Margaret Mahaney</i>
Turkey Feed with a good feed
of lettuce. At night I give them the
sting nettle again with bread soaked in
milk and squeezed dry and a little
chopped onion, if convenient. You will
find that the birds you feed the sting
nettle to will throw the red three weeks
before the ones that do not have it fed
to them.</p>

<div>
  <a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'></a>
<h3 id='av3' class='c017'>AVOID VERMIN</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014' >When the little chicks first come out,
before you put them in the coop, you
must remember to disinfect with my
salve on the head and under the wings;
also give the foster mother the same
treatment with the salve, for if there
are vermin on the hen they will leave
the hen and go to the little turkeys
and unless cared for the little birds
will sicken and die. If affected with
lice the bodies will become very red and
irritated. You will find the lice especially
under the wings or in the fringe
of the wings. When the feathers do
not grow evenly on a little turkey (some
growing long while others are short)
you will know that the turkey has lice,
and you should at once “get busy.”
One or two doses of my salve will make
a marked improvement. I always disinfect
the hen when I put her on the
<a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'></a>eggs, but never disinfect her after the
fifteenth day for at that time there is
life in the chick, and you are very apt
to kill it, as they breathe through the
air cells of the egg.</p>

<h3 id='ts3' class='c017'>THE SETTING OF THE TURKEY HEN</h3>

<p class='c014' >In the wild state the hen seeks the
most secluded and inaccessible spot
where there is protection from birds
and beasts of prey. Security against
attack is the main thing instinct
prompts her to look out for. A tangled
thicket of briars, a sheltering ledge, a
hollow stump, a clump of brush filled
with decaying leaves suits her fancy.
With little preparation she drops her
eggs on the bare ground in these secluded
places. Domestic turkeys are
usually allowed a good deal of freedom
in choosing their nests. I generally set
them the same as I do the common hen.
<a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'></a>A half bushel basket is a comfortable
nest for a turkey hen, and will give
plenty of room for fifteen or eighteen
eggs.</p>

<div id='f047' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic007'>
<img src='images/facing047.jpg' alt='' class='ig007' />
<p>BREEDING PENS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014' >Turkeys require a good deal of attention
while they are on the nests. They
should be in one yard or building, or at
least, not far distant from one another
that it may take as little time as possible
to make the frequent visits necessary
to each. Give the eggs room and
have the nest deep enough to prevent
their rolling out of the nest. A turkey
hen will lay from fifteen to thirty eggs
at a litter, but she cannot always cover
the whole lot. Very large old birds
will cover twenty eggs; smaller birds
will cover from fifteen to eighteen
which is about the proper number to
allow one bird to take care of.</p>

<p class='c014' >If you have a dozen turkey hens in
your flock,—which is about the right
<a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'></a>number for a good range,—it will not
be difficult to set several birds at once,
and this may be arranged by placing
the nests containing artificial eggs
within a few feet of each other. You
can keep part of the hens upon their
nests a few days until three or four are
ready to sit. Then select eggs of as
near equal age as possible and put them
under the hens that are sitting persistently.
If the hens close together are
not set at the same time, there is danger
when the first begins to hatch that her
neighbor will hear the peep of the first
chick and perhaps forsake her nest. If
all the group of three or four nests are
hatching at the same time, there is no
trouble of this kind.</p>

<p class='c014' >Before putting the eggs in the nest it
is well to disinfect the hen with turkey
salve under her wings. It will prevent
vermin of any kind.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_49' id='Page_49'></a>If any of the eggs get fouled with the
yolk of a broken egg before or after
setting, the shells should be carefully
cleaned with warm water to secure
their hatching. Two or three turkeys
will sometimes lay in the same nest.
This will do no harm in the early part
of the season, but they should be separated
before setting, allowing only one
bird to a nest. This may be done by
making nests nearby and putting porcelain
eggs into each new nest. Turkeys
are not liable to crowd onto an occupied
nest when there is a vacant one nearby.
The group of hens that sit together,
and bring off their young at the same
time, will naturally feed and ramble together,
and this will save time in looking
after them.</p>

<p class='c014' >The turkey is a close sitter and will
not leave her nest for several days at
a time. Grain and water should be kept
<a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'></a>near the nest all the time. When the
turkeys begin to hatch I take the little
chicks out just the same as I do when
under a common hen, and give the ones
that are not hatched a chance to do so.</p>

<p class='c014' >When they are all ready to go into the
coop, I lift the hen very gently and carry
her to the coop, generally putting
the little turkeys into the coops first as
the turkey hen is a very nervous bird
and will scratch around and sometimes
walk on the little birds.</p>

<div id='f051' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic008'>
<img src='images/facing051.jpg' alt='' class='ig008' />
<p>TURKEYS SHOULD BE TAMED</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014' >That is why I like to have them good
and strong before they go into the coop
with the mother. The little fellows
seem to understand that the mother
should not step on them for they will
crowd over towards the side of the coop
out of her reach. She will soon get
used to them and to being fed and will
settle down to taking care of her babies
in good shape, as the turkey hen is a
<a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'></a>very devoted mother. She will watch
out for those who feed her and take care
of her little babies. They will run to
meet me when they see me coming, that
is, of course, if they are out in the field.
I have had them come home themselves
when I let them out for a ramble, and
when I have gone to feed them the
mother would be in the coop with all
her little babies.</p>

<p class='c014' >I give the same treatment to the turkey
chicks that are brought up by their
mother as I do when they are brought
up by a common hen, only the common
hen will leave them long before the turkey
hen will think of forsaking her
babies. I have gone into the turkey
house when they were five or six months
old and would find a young turkey pullet
nestling close to her mother. You
do not find this in any other domestic
bird that I know of.</p>

  <a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'></a>
  <h2 id='th2' class='c004'>THE THROWING OF THE RED AND YOUNG TURKEYS</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_8_0_9 c016'     >As there seems to be some difference
of opinion about the “throwing
of the red”, first let me tell you what
the throwing of the red means.</p>

<p class='c014' >More or less blood must flow into the
brain and head of the turkey when it
shows so plainly through the skin.
When a turkey is five weeks old or even
four, it is time for it to begin to “throw
the red”, as when blood comes from the
liver and heart, of course it must have
some action on the little pullets. I
have had young turkeys throw the red
in five weeks, and show it very plainly,—that
is after being fed twice a day on
sting nettle. On the other hand, before
<a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'></a>I knew what to feed to them, I have had
them linger along up until seven or
eight weeks, and at the end of that time,
they would usually die. What had
happened was that the blood had returned
to the liver, become stagnant
and caused diarrhea, which, of course,
caused the death of the young turkey.
When a young turkey is in good condition
it ought to shoot the red from the
beginning to the end in ten days. Of
course it will not be as prominent as in
a larger bird. As the bird grows, the
red becomes more apparent.</p>

<p class='c014' >When the little turkey is about four
weeks old the feathers will begin to fall
from the head some. Then you will
know that the critical time is at hand.
The little bird begins to shoot the red.
It mopes around sometimes for days.
There will be nothing wrong with him
except that he just does not feel well.
<a name='Page_57' id='Page_57'></a>Give plenty of sting nettle and a little
tincture of iron three times a week (4
drops of tincture of iron to a gallon of
drinking water) and you will see an
improvement in a couple of days.</p>

<p class='c014' >The young toms are much stronger
than the pullets. Some of them will
shoot the red and grow splendidly all
through it with no signs of any drooping
whatever, but there is always a
marked change in the little pullets.</p>

<p class='c014' >After the red is grown, the secret of
success in turkeys is to keep them
growing. You can give them all the
skimmed milk and all the sour milk they
will drink. Feed them all the lettuce
they can eat three times a day with nettle
in the feed, if you have it on the
place. It is one of the necessities in
raising turkeys that you keep the liver
clean and if you feed lettuce two or
<a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'></a>three times a day, the droppings will be
a bright green and in good condition.</p>

<p class='c014' >For my birds I have large runs, 6 ft.
each way, which makes a good square
run. I move the runs every day to
clean ground; the straw is taken out
and aired. If it is damp weather, put
clean straw in at least every other day.
My coops are high and well ventilated
at the top which takes off all the hot and
impure air, and helps keep the little
turkeys strong and healthy. I allow
about ten runs out at a time consisting
of ten birds each and let them go for a
good long ramble. They do not stay
away from their houses very long, however,
but soon get tired and come back,
usually staying out about two hours.
Then I put them in their coops and
let out about ten more runs. When I
put them back into the coops I feed
them lettuce and clean drinking water.
<a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'></a>(I continue this process until I have
let out the entire flock.) I let out so
many runs at a time so there will be
no confusion in putting them in. I do
this daily, every fair day, until the turkey
is four or five months old. Then
I let them all out together. I put them
in larger houses every night, keep them
good and warm, with good roosts and
clean straw, and I have very little
trouble from disease.</p>

<p class='c014' >Every turkey should be allowed out
for a while each day if the weather is
fine and there are no signs of rain.
If it is lowery or dark, do not let them
out until the weather is pleasant again.
This method of letting them out keeps
them growing rapidly and makes them
very tame so that they can be handled
much more easily.</p>

<p class='c014' >Why not give a turkey the same care
that we give a hen. People tell me
<a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'></a>many ways in which their turkeys are
neglected. They seem to think that
they do not need to look after turkeys
and after they are hatched they turn
them out and let them wander and forage
for themselves. The time of that
kind of treatment for turkeys is past.
Remember we are raising turkeys now
by the approved methods and full feeding
applied to modern poultry raising.
People will come to me and tell me that
their turkey hens are roosting out in the
trees nights when it is below zero. As
I have stated before, if it is in January
these turkey hens are beginning to grow
eggs. What vitality is there back of
eggs grown under conditions of that
kind? None whatever.</p>

<p class='c014' >On hot days you must cover the runs
with burlap or shade of some description.
<a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'></a>I use the burlap sacks in which I
receive dried bread waste that I buy.</p>

<p class='c014' >With reference to feeding bread, be
sure never to feed bread that is mouldy
for if you do you will start diarrhea in
the young turkeys in no time.</p>

<p class='c014' >When fall is coming on you must be
very careful of the pullets. As I said
before, they are much more subject to
blackhead than are the toms. When I
house them up,—that is, in large
houses, say forty or fifty to one pen, I
have my prepared feed for turkeys
(<i>Margaret Mahaney’s Turkey Feed</i>)
before the pullets all the time. The
less corn you give any turkey hen the
less trouble you will have from blackhead,
for corn is heating. To keep the
pullets in good condition you will find
all the ingredients in this prepared
feed, which is put up and sold now by
The Park &amp; Pollard Company, 46 Canal
<a name='Page_62' id='Page_62'></a>Street, Boston, under the name of
<i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i> Turkey Feed.</p>

<p class='c014' >Give more or less whole corn to the
toms if you want to get them in good
condition for shipping or for dressing
around Thanksgiving. They do not
fatten up as quickly as the turkey hen,
which is the reason I keep all corn and
corn meal away from the turkey hens.</p>

<p class='c014' >Put one-half teaspoonful of salicylate
of soda in the drinking water in
each pan at night. In the mornings
give them fresh water and twice a week
place in it a little tincture of iron (4
drops to each gallon of water). Do
this up to about January, and then, if
your turkey hens are kept warm and
comfortable, they are over the dangers
of the blackhead season.</p>

<p class='c014' >Give the same treatment to the young
toms.</p>

  <h2 id='iv2' class='c004'>INVESTIGATION OF DISEASES</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c016'     >“What <em>is</em> the disease?” is the
first and most important
question to ask. The number of people
who fatefully assume from the beginning
that the answer to this question
is beyond their reach is inexcusably
large. If the non-professional
reader would apply even a limited
amount of study and common sense
many of the lesser ills might be avoided,
and many others successfully treated.
A little special instruction is here
given to enable one to detect a disease
before it is too late, and thus, in a
great measure, to avoid those disheartening
ravages which, at times, come upon
the uninformed owner of turkeys.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'></a>The small number of diseases which
are liable to be confused makes it comparatively
easy to form the right conclusion
by eliminating from the possible
list those that do not show the particular
symptoms of the other diseases.</p>

<p class='c014' >A general knowledge of the organism,
habits, and appearance of turkeys
when in health is, of course, very desirable.
A reasonably close observation
is about all we can expect in this matter
from the ordinary owner of a large
flock of turkeys. The experienced fancier
adds to this a frequent handling
and more detailed study to learn the
normal hardness and suppleness of the
flesh and the warmth, moisture and color
of the skin, especially about the vent,
and the outline and structure of the
skeleton. It is also eminently desirable
that one know what is a right condition
of all the organs, but this is particularly
<a name='Page_67' id='Page_67'></a>true in respect to the liver and other digestive
organs.</p>

<p class='c014' >One of the most common mistakes in
the discovery of a disease is the forming
of a decision after too little study.
Finding one or two symptoms which are
known to attend a suspected ailment,
one is prone to jump at the conclusion
that he has detected the real difficulty,
when a further investigation would reveal
other symptoms, which, in conjunction
with these, would lead to the true
conclusion. Every examination, therefore,
should be thorough until a degree
of certainty is felt. It is essential, too,
that the raiser not expect that the disease
will invariably present just the
symptoms mentioned in any book, for
they will vary more or less in different
turkeys, and even in the same one at
different times,—a caution which merely
<a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'></a>calls for the exercise of judgment and
common sense.</p>

<p class='c014' >When any doubt is felt on the contagious
nature of a disease, the affected
turkey should be removed from the
flock until the possible danger is passed.
When a bird dies from an unknown
cause, it should be opened and the condition
of the internal organs noted,
along with a study of their condition as
taken up in the following pages of treatment.</p>

<p class='c014' >In general, it may be observed that
the presence of lice and mites is often
the cause of weakness and loss of condition,
especially if the turkeys are allowed
to roost with the common hens.</p>

  <h2 id='bl2' class='c004'>BLACKHEAD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_7 c016'     >A great many people write to
me, saying that they lose their
pullets and young turkeys after they
have grown the first feathers. I never
lose a turkey at that time. I grow my
turkeys in runs as you would chickens
and it is a beautiful sight to see well
onto three hundred healthy, strong turkeys
in runs placed side by side. I
never have any trouble with my young
turkeys. As I said before in another
part of my work, blackhead never appears
in my flock until the turkey is six
and seven months old. When I see any
signs of blackhead, I move all my turkeys
to new ground, disinfect all my
coops with Presto Disinfectant, and
<a name='Page_72' id='Page_72'></a>start in to cure my blackhead, as described
on page <a href='#Page_79'>79</a>. I wait for a wet
day, and put lime on the ground that I
moved the coops from, as turkeys are
very apt to return to their old dwelling
place. In that way, I keep down blackhead.
It is a very simple disease if
taken in time and easily cured.</p>

<p class='c014' >When I first started raising turkeys,
my little pullets died after they were
feathered and about seven or eight
weeks old. Some of them would not
shoot the red until they were weighing
two and a half pounds. Their heads
would be dark, and their steps slow and
dragging. As I said before, the blood
lay dormant in the liver, and thus started
blackhead. If a turkey does not
throw the red, when seven or eight
weeks old, on close examination it will
be found that the abdomen is dark and
of a bluish cast. The flesh is not in
<a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'></a>good condition, whereas in a young
healthy turkey that has thrown the red
at that age, the flesh will be pure and
white.</p>

<h3 id='my3' class='c017'>MY FIRST SUCCESSFUL FIGHT AGAINST BLACKHEAD</h3>

<p class='c014' >When I first started to raise turkeys,
and one came down with blackhead, I
thought that there was no cure for her.
I did all I possibly could, and if she died,
I judged that she had to and that there
was absolutely nothing that could be
done to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c014' >One year I brought two handsome
pullets in from Kentucky. They were
fine, strong handsome birds, well
marked, with splendid barrings, and a
beautiful bronze. I grew extremely
fond of them. When the spring of the
year came on, about the last of March,
around laying time, one of those two
<a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'></a>birds came down with blackhead and I
determined that I would make a fight
for her life.</p>

<p class='c014' >She was an extremely sick bird. I
took her into the house, placed her in
the back hall, in a cast-off oval shaped
clothes basket. I put soft burlap under
her and wrapped her up warmly.
I had a good knowledge of homeopathic
remedies, and I started to cure bowel
and liver troubles. The fever I kept
down with aconite by giving a drop in
a little water every hour. I stayed by
the side of that turkey all night long.
There were times when she would
scream with pain, and then I placed
her feet in water as hot as she could
bear it with plenty of mustard in it,
and allowed the water to come up as
high as the first joint of her legs. I
allowed her to stand in that about ten
minutes at a time, and then I dried
her feet and legs and placed her back
in the basket. She would be very weak
<a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'></a>after this treatment, but seemed easier.
At other times she would become weak
and lifeless, and I would then take her
up in my arms, go out-of-doors and let
her have the benefit of the cool air. The
fight went on in this way until four
o’clock in the morning, when she opened
her eyes, raised her head, looked up at
me and chirped a little. I decided then
and there that there was such a thing
as curing blackhead.</p>

<p class='c014' >I did not know then so much about
the stoppage in the bowels. I did know,
however, that nothing had passed
through her bowels. I gave her a little
warm whisky and milk, some more
of my remedies, and then went for a
couple of hours’ rest myself. When I
went to her again about two hours afterward,
the red had begun to flow back
into her head, the fever had left her,
and her pulse was normal. The pulse
<a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'></a>of a turkey begins to beat just above the
crop and in case of death, will gradually
creep up until, just before the breath
leaves the bird, it will have reached a
point under the throat. I kept the
pulse in this bird down to the middle of
the neck; I never let it get any further.
There were times when I had to place
a cloth dipped in ice water on her head,
but I was fighting for the life of my little
pet, and she seemed to realize what
I was doing. She was very weak all the
morning. I took her up, placed her out
on the lawn in the sun, and she staggered
to her feet about twelve o’clock
of that day, and then a solid core came
from her bowels. This had lodged in
the cecum. At that time I knew very
little about this trait of the disease.
Attached to the core was a part of the
lining of the intestine. The turkey hen
was very weak for days. One thing in
<a name='Page_77' id='Page_77'></a>her favor was that she had an empty
crop, and I immediately fed her a tablespoonful
of cold water in which was
dissolved four grains of common alum.
That was given in order to form a skin
and harden the sore and raw place in
the bowel after the bird had passed the
core. The turkey hen did not fully recover
for three or four days.</p>

<p>FRIENDS (MISS MAHANEY AND “GRANDMA CLEAVES”)</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014' >That turkey hen is about one of the
best I have on my place. I call her
Grandma Cleaves. The Agricultural
colleges maintain that a bird that has
once been afflicted with blackhead is unfit
for breeding stock. I have in my
possession a young tom that was
hatched out the fifteenth day of July,
1912, by that bird. He weighs 31 lbs.
and is well developed in every way.
She laid three litters of eggs last summer,
and sat on the last litter, hatched
twelve turkeys and raised eleven in that
<a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'></a>flock. In my opinion, a bird that has
passed through blackhead is one of the
best and strongest birds to breed from.
I never had a bird come down the second
season with blackhead. It is just
like any other common fever that is
contagious, and can afflict a person but
once.</p>

<p class='c014' >After winning that fight, I made up
my mind that something could be done
for blackhead, and from that time on I
have had great success in battling
against this disease.</p>

<p class='c014' >My breeding grounds are not so far
distant but that the people of Massachusetts
can come to see me. I would
be very glad to show them my runs and
turkeys and my methods of breeding.</p>

<h3 id='to3' class='c017'>TO DETECT BLACKHEAD</h3>

<p class='c014' >Blackhead is the disease to be most
dreaded by the turkey raisers in New
England and all over the country.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'></a>When you go into the turkey house
in the morning, go directly to the droppings
board and see if you find any
yellow droppings. If you do, look carefully
over your flock. It will not take
you long to discover the bird that has
blackhead. The head is an unhealthy
dusky gray, and the bird will mope
around, apparently wanting to eat and
yet not doing so. Then you can decide
that you have blackhead in your flock.</p>

<h3 id='tr3' class='c017'>TREATMENT OF FULL GROWN TURKEYS</h3>

<p class='c014' >Take that bird away immediately;
disinfect her head and under the wings
with salve; massage the crop gently to
see if it is full of undigested food. If
it is, give a scant half teaspoonful of
epsom salts in a little water. In about
an hour’s time give a tablespoonful of
olive oil and follow with a quarter of
a teaspoonful salicylate of soda in two
<a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'></a>tablespoonfuls of warm water. After
the crop is emptied put her in a box,
say a good sized packing case, with
plenty of straw, and cover with burlap.
Give a teaspoonful of warm whisky and
a tablespoonful of milk mixed together.
This will keep up the vitality of the
bird. A long necked milk testing bottle
comes in very handy in a flock of any
kind of fowl, for you can place the neck
down below the windpipe and inject
the liquids into the crop without any
choking on the part of the fowl. Then
watch and see if the droppings are
yellow. If they are give one of the
<i>Mahaney</i> Blackhead pills every hour
until the droppings become normal.
You can place the pill on the tongue
of the turkey and make her swallow it.
If there is nothing in the crop except
a brash of sour wind, give the pills and
hot milk and whiskey at once.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'></a>Be sure to keep the bird warm for
a few days, and then disinfect before
she goes out with the rest of the flock.
Look over the droppings board every
morning and see if there are any yellow
droppings. Use plenty of lime.
Twice a week, in the morning, give
sulphate of iron, powdered, (one level
teaspoonful in a gallon of water in
an earthen dish). The other days, at
night, give salicylate of soda in the
same amount in the drinking water.
This will keep your flock in good condition.</p>

<h3 id='bl3' class='c017'>BLACKHEAD IN YOUNG TURKEYS</h3>

<p class='c014' >The first symptom of blackhead in
the young turkeys has the appearance
of a common cold in the head. The
turkey will sniff and water will sometimes
come from the nose. The loss of
appetite is apparent. The wings droop
and when you let the turkeys out of the
<a name='Page_82' id='Page_82'></a>coops, the one affected will drag itself
along behind the rest of the flock. I
take that bird away from the rest. I
disinfect the head and under the wings
with my salve. Rub the salve lightly
on the head. Hold the turkey gently
across the back, press the wings down
to the side. If you are not very gentle
with them, and very careful, you are
liable to break the wings.</p>

<p class='c014' >The moment you see one become lifeless,
with dragging steps and loss of
appetite, disinfect the whole flock with
the salve twice a week. Dissolve in an
earthen dish four or five of the <i>Margaret
Mahaney</i> Turkey Pills in a little
warm water; then mix the solution in
a quart of drinking water and give to
the young turkeys to drink. This, repeated
every day, with the straw well
aired and kept clean, and the coop dry
and water-proof, will make them show
<a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'></a>a marked improvement in three days.
I never lose a young turkey. They
thrive just as well as little chickens,
and I think they are just as hardy.</p>

<p>WOMEN MAKE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TURKEY RAISERS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c014' >As vermin is one of the enemies of
young turkeys, use the salve twice a
week always, and use it in the morning.
Do not shut them up after putting on
my salve because it is very strong. Let
it evaporate before the little chickens
go to bed at night, and you will have
no vermin. There is an old saying
about a louse in the head of a turkey
which enters the brain and causes
blackhead. I know very well that that
does not cause blackhead, as this disease
comes from a common cold, which
descends to the bowels and liver and
kills the turkey after a few days’ suffering
if not relieved.</p>

<h3 id='st3' class='c017'>STARTS WITH A COMMON COLD</h3>
</div>

<h3 id='te3' class='c017'>Treatment of a Common Cold.</h3>

<p class='c020' >Blackhead starts from a common
cold. When you have a bird in your
flock afflicted with a cold, place a small
teaspoonful of Epsom Salts to one gallon
of water. Do this three or four
days in succession and put plenty of
lime around your turkey houses. I put
lime on the droppings boards every
day; it will kill the disease in no time
and do no injury to the turkey. Of
course I put clean straw in my turkey
house in damp weather every other day
as the straw becomes damp and is very
liable to breed disease.</p>

<p class='c014' >Give this Epsom Salts treatment in
the hot weather whether the birds show
symptoms of disease or not. It keeps
their blood cool and avoids the tendency
to disease.</p>

<p class='c014' >The time for blackhead season is in
<a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'></a>what is commonly called “dog days,”
that is, mid-summer. The weather is
heavy and dark and is very injurious
to young turkeys. That is the time
you must keep your coops good and dry
and give plenty of green stuff, with
aconite in the drinking water about
twice a week to keep down any fever.
Three drops in a pint of water is all I
give them as aconite is very poisonous.
If you have any sting nettle at the time
be sure to feed it, as sting nettle <em>is one
of the greatest aids to success in raising
young turkeys</em>.</p>

<p class='c014' >When the turkey dies of blackhead
the crop becomes apparently black and
inflamed, and is very foul. The liver
is enlarged, and has white or yellowish
spots all over it. In some places it has
the appearance of being eaten away.
Underneath the liver, next to the back
of the bird and around the heart you
<a name='Page_86' id='Page_86'></a>will find a brownish substance, just the
same as you would find in a person who
dies from peritonitis. You will also
find in what is called the second stomach,
that is, the bowel leading to the
gizzard, a large core. Sometimes this
will be very dark brownish yellow or
ochre color, mingled with blood. This
core forms a stoppage, and unless it is
removed, is certain death for the
turkey.</p>

<p class='c014' >I have had turkeys die with what is
commonly called in human beings, “appendicitis”,
as the appendix was matterated
and badly swollen. In fact, in
a bad case of blackhead all the bowels
of the turkey become swollen. The gizzard
is twice its natural size, the abdomen
becomes swollen and black and the
odor is very obnoxious. In a bad case
of this kind there is nothing that can
be done, the disease having become too
<a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'></a>far advanced, and that is why one ought
to watch turkeys very closely. If the
turkey is taken in time and <i>Margaret
Mahaney’s</i> pills given, and the turkey
is kept warm, (for they will take the
disease first with a chill just the same
as a human being would take malaria)
there is no need of any loss in the flock
from blackhead. All the colleges of
agriculture have diagnosed the case as
a parasite on the intestines, but I have
thoroughly investigated that theory,
and wish to say that I have found no
grounds for such a belief.</p>

<div class='nf-center c015'   >
    <div>(Sometimes confused with Blackhead)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_7 c019'     >I have a great many people write
me in regard to weak legs in turkeys.
Of course, this is common rheumatism.
The limbs suffer an impairment
or loss of use, are hot, swollen and
stiff. The toes then being drawn out
of shape, the fowl persistently sits
down and cannot use the perch. The
heart may become involved and this
produces death. I had it in my flock
one year,—that is, I had several birds
victims to the disease. They would
squat down all the time. The breast
bone grew all over to one side from sitting
so much. They were fat and apparently
healthy, except that they could
not seem to stand up any length of
<a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'></a>time. I bathed their feet with mustard
and water as hot as I thought they
could stand it. I saved most of them,
but it seemed to me that they never
could walk as well as the flock that had
not been affected. The cause of this
affliction is that the turkeys are allowed
out too early in the morning when the
dew is on the grass and allowed to roam
around in damp places. At this time
I was raising my flock on lowland. I
have never had any of it in my flock
since I moved to high and dry land.
Give five drops of bryonia in a pint of
drinking water to six turkeys. After
using the mustard water be careful to
wipe the turkey’s legs dry and then rub
well with camphorated oil the backs of
the legs leading into the body. Keep
in a warm and dry place and give sulphur
in the feed (about a half teaspoonful
to four turkeys).</p>

<h3 id='ro3' class='c017'>“ROTTEN CROP” SOMETIMES MISTAKEN FOR BLACKHEAD</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014' >Another disease very common in turkeys
which is called blackhead and yet
has nothing to do with blackhead, is
what you would call “rotten crop” in a
common hen. When this takes place
the crop becomes very foul and heavy.
The bird will drink water, which stays
in the crop and becomes sour. I have
often had to take the bird up, hold the
head down and rub the crop gently so
that all the water would run from the
mouth. With the aid of a long neck
milk testing bottle I fill the crop with
warm water with a quarter teaspoonful
baking soda in it, and relieve the
crop by massaging the second time.
Then I give a tablespoonful of olive oil.
Put the bird away from the rest, with
very little feed for a couple of days.
I never have any difficulty in saving a
<a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'></a>bird affected with what is commonly
called “rotten crop.” If not relieved,
however, it will turn into blackhead
and the turkey will die.</p>

<h3 id='cl3' class='c017'>COLD—CATARRH—COUGH—BRONCHITIS</h3>

<p class='c014' >All of these are substantially different
stages and symptoms of the same
disorder. Exposure to wet and cold is
the general cause. Cough is, indeed, a
symptom, not a disease, and is connected
with the other three. It may, however,
attend other diseases, and when
its cause is not known, the article
pertaining to roup should especially
be consulted. Bronchitis is but an
advanced stage or aggravated form
of cold or catarrh. The three are
marked by more or less discharge from
the eyes and nostrils, sneezing, wheezing,
and, particularly in bronchitis,
coughing and a rattling sound in the
throat. To distinguish this from roup,
<a name='Page_95' id='Page_95'></a>see whether the discharge is offensive.
If it is, roup is to be treated; if not,
catarrh or bronchitis. In all cases of
doubt, use the precautions detailed for
roup.</p>

<p class='c014' >Turkeys are subject to roup from the
time they are babies, more so than common
hens, as a cold is the cause of all
their trouble.</p>

<p class='c014' >Treatment: Remove the turkey to
warm, dry shelter, and give warm, soft
food. These measures will usually be
sufficient, but the following will be valuable
as aids: <i>For cold or catarrh</i>
merely, and no distinction between
them is here made, put three drops of
strong tincture of aconite in a pint of
the drink. If there is a swelling about
the throat, two or three grains of the
second trituration of mercuries three
times a day will be useful. <i>For bronchitis</i>,
in addition to the measures just
<a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'></a>named, give sweetened water for the
drink, adding a few drops of nitric acid
or sulphuric acid. <i>For both catarrh
and bronchitis</i> give some stimulant,
such as ginger or cayenne pepper in
the food or whisky in the water. Treat
catarrh and cold promptly, to keep them
from developing into roup. Do not
neglect bronchitis lest it run into consumption.</p>

<h3 id='rp3' class='c017'>ROUP</h3>

<p class='c014' >Roup is a highly contagious malady
which first affects the lining membrane
of the beak and then extends to the
eyes, throat, and whole head, eventually
involving the entire constitution.
According to its manifest symptoms,
it has been called diphtheria, sore
head, swelled eyes, hoarseness, bronchitis,
canker, snuffles, influenza, sore
throat, quinsy, blindness, and by other
names. It attacks all ages, and will
<a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'></a>kill young turkeys in a very short time.
Turkeys given poor shelter, and kept in
filthy quarters, are subject to roup.</p>

<p class='c014' >Symptoms:—Roup develops either
slowly or rapidly, with the general
signs of a bad cold in the head, such
as wheezing, or sneezing, high fever
and great thirst. The discharge from
the eyes and nose is yellowish, being at
first thin but growing thicker as the
disease develops, and very offensive,
closing the eyes, nostrils and throat
(these parts and the whole head are
swollen, sometimes enormously, so that
blindness ensues, making the turkey
unable to get its food, and thus hastening
the decline of the system); pustular
sores about the head and in the
throat, discharging a frothy mucus;
the breathing is impeded; the crop is
often swollen; the comb and wattles
may be pale or dark-colored. During
<a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'></a>the course of the disease the turkey is
feeble and moping. A fatal case terminates
in from three to eight days
after the distinctive roup-symptoms
set in, and those which are not treated
when an epidemic is prevailing will
generally be fatal. Upon opening a
turkey that has died of roup one will
find the liver and gall bladder full of
pus, the flesh soft, of a bad odor, and,
particularly about the lungs, slimy and
spongy.</p>

<p class='c014' >Treatment:—It is of the highest importance
that the treatment begin as
soon as the first symptoms appear. To
<a id='detect' />detect the approach of the disease, (and
any turkey in the flock should be suspected
if one has been infected), raise
the wing and ascertain whether the
feathers beneath it are stuck together,
as the turkey has the habit of wiping
<a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'></a>its nose under the wings, and naturally
the feathers will become matted and
foul.</p>

<p class='c014' >Remove the turkey to a good warm
place; wash her head with warm water
with a drop or two of sulpho-napthol
in the water; dry well with a good soft
cloth and rub <i>Mahaney</i> turkey salve on
her head, throat and crop; open up her
beak and oil the inside of her mouth
and throat well with the salve. A little
swab can be made for that purpose.
Give one of the <i>Margaret Mahaney</i>
blackhead pills, three times a day, and
make a pill as large as a good sized
bean as follows, one-half mustard and
one-half sulphur; equal parts. Give
the turkey one of these pills every
night, and if swollen eyes and head
has prevented her from seeing her food,
feed her a little bread and milk, soft
and warm, until she is able to feed herself.
<a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'></a>A drop or two of kerosene oil in
the drinking water makes a good disinfectant
for turkeys.</p>

<p class='c014' >When a disease of this kind enters
your turkey house disinfect your droppings
boards, and feed five quarts of
hot mash from <i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i>
Turkey Feed with one or two onions
chopped fine and put in the mash. A
teaspoonful of red pepper also given
to them every night before going to
roost will help to prevent the disease
from spreading. Keep your turkey
house clean and dry, and if you see
any sign of this disease it is much better
to remove the droppings every day,
and if taken in time roup is not a fatal
disease.</p>

<h3 id='cn3' class='c017'>CONSUMPTION OF THE THROAT</h3>

<p class='c014' >The special symptoms of consumption
of the throat are a frequent cough,
<a name='Page_101' id='Page_101'></a>roughness of the voice, and often a
failure to partake of food either from
loss of appetite or from pain caused
by swallowing. Attacks of fever, followed
by shivering, are more or less
regular. For treatment keep the bird
in a very warm atmosphere, chop up
onions very fine and mix in the feed,
also give a teaspoonful of olive oil three
times a day with one to two drops of
aconite to a cup of water.</p>

<p class='c014' >I generally have what is commonly
called a hospital for sick birds; that is,
I set aside one coop, keep it warm and
have it heated with an incubator lamp,
a large one. The temperature should
be kept around 70 degrees, until the
bird ceases to cough.</p>

<h3 id='cs3' class='c017'>CONSUMPTION OF THE LUNGS</h3>

<p class='c014' >A distinct feature of consumption of
the chest or lungs is a tubercular deposit
<a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'></a>in the chest, liver and bowels.
The first symptoms are a thinning of
the voice and occasionally sneezing.
When the sneezing comes on in the
morning and continues during the day,
the lungs have become involved, and
eventually a puffed appearance will be
manifest in the chest. Give the same
treatment for consumption of the chest
as given for consumption of the throat.
Add a few drops of tincture of iron
(four drops to a gallon of water) to
the water each day until the appearance
of the bird has improved.</p>

<p class='c014' >Light, ventilation and pure air are
three of nature’s most potent agencies
in counteracting disease. Every turkey
should have a liberal allowance of
sunlight, though the power and directness
of the rays should be determined
by the climate, which is only natural.
Among those that need frequent sun
<a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'></a>baths are the wild birds of the air and
as the turkey was originally a wild
bird, in the very nature of things, it
demands a great deal of sunlight. It
makes no difference how hot the day is,
the turkey will lie in the sun and seem
to enjoy it when the temperature is
even up to 100 degrees. This is the
reason I keep my turkeys warm and
comfortable, as it is a preventive of
consumption or any disease of that
nature.</p>

<p class='c014' >A good dirt bath should be provided
for a turkey all winter; light sand,
half clay, with a measure of air-slacked
lime. The turkey will wallow in that
for an hour at a time, thoroughly enjoy
it and seem so much brighter after it.</p>

<p class='c014' >If turkeys are allowed to run on the
frozen ground and roost in the trees all
winter, how can one reasonably expect
them to remain in a healthy condition
<a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'></a>when they positively need warm, comfortable
quarters? If suitable houses
are provided for turkeys, warm, clean
and comfortable with plenty of lime,
grit and charcoal during the winter
months, it will be found that there will
be very little trouble with blackhead
during the summer and consequently
less tendency to consumption and other
diseases in the colder months.</p>

<h3 id='sw3' class='c017'>SWOLLEN HEADS</h3>

<p class='c014' >Swollen heads in turkeys seems to
me to be the prevailing disease this
spring of 1913. Complaints have come
to me from all over the country, also
sick birds have been sent to me to treat.</p>

<p class='c014' >I do not know whether it would be
called roup or canker, but the appearance
of it is that of a common cold, a
watery discharge from the nose, eyes
half closed, and sometimes wholly
<a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'></a>closed, with a large projecting formation
in the orbital cavity under the
eyes, which, if left there, will cause the
death of the turkey after the turkey
loses its sight. Press your hand gently
on the formation. If the formation
has not become hard, but is still in a
spongy condition, press firmly on both
sides of the nose under the eyes, and
force out the thick, foul discharge
which has gathered. Wash the head
with Sulpho-Napthol or Presto Disinfectant,
dry well, and then disinfect
with my salve. Repeat this every day
until the turkey is well. In the meantime
the turkey will have a little hacking
cough that is caused by a watery
discharge from the head, which flows
down inside the nose and drops on to
the windpipe. A human being has a
chance to relieve the head and throat,
but the turkey does not have this advantage.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_106' id='Page_106'></a>If, however, the formation in the
orbital cavity has become hard, an
operation is necessary. Have some
one hold the bird gently on its side,
with its wings close to the body in natural
form, for in the struggle, the bird
is very apt to break its wing. Wash
the head with Sulpho-Napthol or Presto
Disinfectant and dry well. Have ready
a good sharp operating knife, thoroughly
sterilized, and also sterilize your
hands. About one-fourth inch below
the eye you will find one or two leaders.
You must try to avoid cutting through
these. Always try to avoid cutting
through any veins. Make a clean cut
about one-half inch in length, running
straight down the orbital cavity to the
beak so that when it heals up it will
leave no scar. If the turkey is in good
blood and a male bird, they are very
apt to bleed quite a little. I would then
<a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'></a>stop the blood with cotton batten, or by
bathing with water mixed with a little
alum. Leave the bird for that day.
The next morning open up the cut,
take out the canker, which you will
find to be a yellow, cheesy substance,
with a very bad odor. Remove all
this canker, wash out the cavity with
peroxide of hydrogen, dry well, fill
the cavity with <i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i>
Salve, which keeps the head soft and
clean. Wash the head lightly for a few
days. When the wound heals up you
will find a sort of dry core in the
wound. Remove this, wash out, and
your turkey is all well. Trust the rest
to nature.</p>

<p class='c014' >If you find that the lump under the
eye has become hard and white before
you operate, and that the blood has
flowed back from the head, there is no
<a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'></a>need of waiting for the wound to stop
bleeding. You can remove the canker
at once.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014' >In the meantime, in the feed put a
half teaspoonful of sulphur each morning
for a week in a warm mush made
from <i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i> Turkey
Feed. This will keep the bowels in
good condition, and hasten the recovery
of the turkey.</p>

<p class='c014' >This canker is sometimes found in
the rectum of the turkey. Syringe the
bird with warm water in which has
been dissolved a little piece of Castile
soap. Add to one quart of water a
half teaspoonful of boric acid, and after
the bird has been thoroughly washed
out, wash again with the above solution.
<a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'></a>Dry the vent thoroughly and
sponge on a little sweet oil. Do this
for a few days with sulphur in the feed,
and you will find that the bird will be
all right. Use about ½ teaspoonful
of sulphur to ½ pint of feed.</p>

<h3 id='so3' class='c017'>SORE EYES AND HEAD</h3>

<p class='c014' >The eyes may become sore from
dust, excessive heat, dampness and
other causes, and give out a watery
discharge. The whole head may become
involved in the inflammation.
Such mild afflictions are to be distinguished
from canker and roup, but it
is always safe to keep a sharp look-out
for the latter when the eyes are sore.</p>

<p class='c014' >Wash the parts with a weak solution
of white vitriol (sulphate of zinc) or
with alum-water, or with a solution of
alum and camphor. If the discharge
has become gummy or hardened, remove
it with warm water and Castile
<a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'></a>soap, followed with alum and water.
Dry the head well with a soft cloth,
and then rub gently with <i>Margaret
Mahaney’s</i> Turkey Salve, as it contains
all the ingredients that heal and
cleanse.</p>

<p class='c014' >To about four turkeys put one-half
teaspoonful of sulphur in the feed with
a shake of red pepper three or four
times a week, and a little tincture of
iron in the water (about four drops to
a gallon of water).</p>

<h3 id='ct3' class='c017'>CONSTIPATION IN TURKEYS</h3>

<p class='c014' >Constipation is caused by indigestion,
taking cold, too close confinement,
too much dry feed and too little green,
a deficient supply of good water and
the like. It is indicated by frequent
attempts to evacuate the bowels, either
wholly unsuccessful or resulting only
in hard, dark droppings. The turkey
is uneasy and perhaps staggers.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'></a>Give an abundance of green food and
a soft mixture of bran and oatmeal and
ten drops of sulphate of magnesia to a
pint of the drinking water. Along with
these directions for the feed, it will be
well to give two drops of aconite to a
half glass of water, giving the bird a
teaspoonful of the solution every hour
until the fever disappears, following
this with a solution made of two drops
of nux vomica to a half glass of water,
giving a teaspoonful of the solution
every hour until well, or if a cold is the
cause, use two drops of bryonia in the
water instead of the nux vomica. I
have often had this disease in my
flock when the turkeys are about three
months old, just before I let them out
for a good day’s ramble, so that is why
I always recommend plenty of good lettuce.
It keeps the bowels in good condition,
keeps the intestines cool, and
makes up itself for all fever remedies.</p>

<div>
  <a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'></a>
<h3 id='di3' class='c017'>DIARRHEA</h3>
</div>

<p class='c014' >This disease is often mistaken for
blackhead in grown turkeys. It may
result from an excessive use of tainted
food, mouldy bread or mouldy grain,
impure water, extreme heat, exposure
in damp weather, filthy quarters and
general indigestion, poison, or any inflammatory
affliction of the intestines
or the stomach.</p>

<p class='c014' >The symptoms are loose droppings
of different colors which befoul the
feathers, lassitude, and a loss of condition.
In dysentery which results from
a diseased condition of the intestines,
the droppings are more frothy and
mingled with blood, and attended with
rapid prostration.</p>

<p class='c014' >A form of diarrhea essentially different
from the two described, occurs
in an old female turkey in which a
white discharge comes away more or
<a name='Page_113' id='Page_113'></a>less constantly, often dribbling out, and
keeps the feathers about the vent incrusted
with a white, chalk-like deposit.
It is doubtless due to some derangement
in the shell-making function, and can
best be treated by promoting the general
health and using the means noted
below.</p>

<p class='c014' >Treatment: Have your pharmacist
make up pills made of a mixture of five
grains of powdered chalk, five of rhubarb,
and five of cayenne pepper, adding
a half grain of opium in severe
cases. Give two pills daily. Another
good remedy is camphorated spirits of
barley meal, three to six grains for each
bird according to age, or ten to twenty
drops of the same may be put in a pint
of the drink. For mild cases and in
the early stages of others, powdered
chalk on boiled rice may be sufficient.
The remedy last named is recommended
<a name='Page_114' id='Page_114'></a>for the white discharge of old females,
for which the pills described above
should be used as well as a little lime
water, made by allowing about ½ teaspoonful
air-slacked lime to ½ pint
water for a bird. Dissolve and then
pour off the liquid for them to drink
instead of plain water.</p>

<p class='c014' >Restrict the drink in all forms of
these disorders and put into it a little
tincture of iron (four drops to a gallon
of water).</p>

<p class='c014' >Dysentery with blood discharges is
a serious disorder. It is best to give a
teaspoonful of castor oil, followed with
three to six drops of laudanum every
few hours, supplying an exclusive diet
of mild food. It is important that the
afflicted bird be kept quiet and apart
from the flock, especially in dysentery.</p>

<p class='c014' >Isolate the afflicted bird when you
are at all doubtful regarding the nature
<a name='Page_115' id='Page_115'></a>of the disorder. Give a couple of tablespoonfuls
of ground chalk to a pint of
warm mash made from <i>Margaret Mahaney’s</i>
Turkey Feed. This will also
be found beneficial at any time to the
laying turkey hens of five or six years
old. Allow one pint of mash to four
turkeys three times a day. A little
camphor, about the size of a good sized
bean, to four turkeys will hasten the
recovery; dropped in the drinking water
once a week, will help to keep the
birds in good laying condition.</p>

<h3 id='da3' class='c017'><i>Diarrhea in Little Turkeys</i></h3>

<p class='c014' >Diarrhea in a little turkey is white,
something the same as that trouble in
a common chicken, and if you look very
carefully you will see that the little legs
are dotted with white, and the little
turkeys will be lifeless and not appearing
to thrive. That is the time to give
them <i>Mahaney</i> pills (four to a quart
<a name='Page_116' id='Page_116'></a>of drinking water for 10 or 11 young
turkeys). Boil a piece of meat, grind
fine, and put in the feed, and that will
help them get back their vitality. A
drop of aconite in the drinking water
on damp days will help to prevent fever
of any kind.</p>

<h3 id='ga3' class='c017'>GAPES</h3>

<p class='c014' >There are many remedies for gapes,
but the following is always beneficial
and dependable. It manifests itself
first by the birds gaping around just
as a person would yawn.</p>

<p class='c014' >Fill a common, long-necked oil can
such as is used for oiling a sewing machine,
with kerosene oil; open the turkey’s
mouth and wait until it breathes
in order that the windpipe may be open,
then inject a good spray of the kerosene,
perhaps a teaspoonful in all. Three
doses will usually cure the turkeys of
the gape worm. Give treatment three
<a name='Page_117' id='Page_117'></a>times a day, in the morning, at noon
and night. Shut the turkeys up in
their run for about a week, then move
them to new ground.</p>

<h3 id='ta3' class='c017'>TAPE WORM</h3>

<p class='c014' >The tape worm is an entirely different
thing and is rather more serious,
and will produce substantially the same
symptoms as indigestion. If they are
in the bowels, costiveness or diarrhea
may be more marked, while the turkey
will be uneasy and picking at the vent
if they are in the lower part of the intestine.
In all cases there will be more
or less loss of flesh and often diminished
gloss in the feathers, while the bird has
either an impaired or a voracious appetite.
The only unmistakable symptom
is the presence of worms in the droppings
when they first pass out.</p>

<p class='c014' >An unhealthy condition of the digestive
organs is the main cause. The
<a name='Page_118' id='Page_118'></a>treatment for this is a teaspoonful of
castor oil followed by a light addition
of sulphur to the feed, and this may
expel the worms and restore the general
health. A little cayenne pepper
in the feed and tincture of iron in the
water will aid the cure. The use of
four drops of oil of ferm to a tablespoonful
of water is beneficial in a case
of this kind. Give in the morning before
the bird has eaten anything.</p>

<p class='c014' >I had one bird this last year which
had a tape worm. I noticed the worm
in the droppings first. I took the bird
away and put her on a board floor and
gave her a good dose of castor oil. She
had only passed half of the worm at one
time, and I watched her very closely
until she passed the head.</p>

<p class='c014' >In a case of tape worm the droppings
will be more or less white and limy. A
turkey requires a great deal of lime.
<a name='Page_119' id='Page_119'></a>I have even seen turkeys pick at an
old wall where it had been plastered.
Lime, mixed with sand, should be left
in all the corners of the farm for turkeys
to eat, as it is a sure preventive of
worms.</p>

<h3 id='pe3' class='c017'>PERITONITIS</h3>

<p class='c014' >Peritonitis in turkeys is often mistaken
for blackhead. It is a very difficult
disease to treat, and it is only with
the milder cases that success can reasonably
be expected. The affected bird
must be kept quiet, protected from any
current of air, and opium in doses of
one (1) grain every four hours is
recommended to quiet the pain and
reduce the movement of the intestines,
or mix three or four drops of aconite
in a half glass of water and give a teaspoonful
three or four times a day. Injections
of tepid water are recommended
to counteract constipation. Take a
<a name='Page_120' id='Page_120'></a>hot water bag. Do not have the water
so hot that it would be uncomfortable
for the turkey; wring a flannel out of
warm water and lay it over the hot
water bag, and then place the bag
against the wall of the abdomen. Renew
them as often as necessary to keep
up a moist heat. This treatment should
be continued from a half hour to an
hour. Repeat three or four times a
day, drying the surface of the wall
afterwards so that the bird will not
take cold. If there is a great weakness,
one or two drops of ether, or four
or five drops of tincture of camphor
may be injected under the skin as a
stimulant.</p>

<p class='c014' >In case the disease is due to rupture
of the oviduct or perforation of the
intestine, treatment is useless; if it has
followed inflammation of the intestine,
the treatment for enteritis should be
combined with that for peritonitis.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_121' id='Page_121'></a>On opening the abdominal cavity of
a turkey which has died from peritonitis,
the lining membrane is found
to be a deep red in color, and is sometimes
covered by an exudate, which
may consist of a thin, transparent
layer, or it may be thick yellowish or
reddish yellow. The abdomen may
contain more or less liquid which may
be transparent or it may be turbid
with a yellow or reddish color. If the
trouble is due to the perforation of the
intestine, the liquid will have a very
offensive odor from the multiplication
of the putrefactive germs. If it has
resulted from the rupture of the oviduct,
the egg, either intact or broken,
will generally be found in the abdominal
cavity, and the ruptured place in
the wall of the oviduct is easily discovered.</p>

<p class='c014' ><a name='Page_122' id='Page_122'></a>The writer had two cases of peritonitis
in her flock of turkey hens just
around the laying season. One died
and the other I succeeded in saving by
the breaking of the bound egg and
washing out the rectum with a syringe.
For a wash of this kind four or five
drops of iodine should be added. It is
good to relieve pain and acts as a stimulant
for the bird. The bird must be
kept very warm and comfortable after
a thing of that kind for three or four
days. It is well to feed the bird on
stimulating food and keep her away
from the breeding pens until she recovers
her strength.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <a name='Page_125' id='Page_125'></a>
  <h2 id='tb2' class='c004'>THE BRONZE TURKEY</h2>
</div>

<h3 id='tg3' class='c017'>THE ORGANS AND SIZE</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c019'     >This variety holds the place of
honor. It probably originated
from a cross between the wild and
the tame product. Its beautiful, rich
plumage and size have come from the
wild progenitor. To maintain this
quality, crosses are continually made.
In this way the mammoth size has been
gained. Their standard weight ranges
from twenty, thirty-six to forty and
fifty pounds, according to age and
sex. Probably more of this variety are
grown each year than all the others.
They have been pushed on all sides,
almost to the exclusion of the others.
Until within a few years, if possible,
<a name='Page_126' id='Page_126'></a>the bronze turkey has been developed
too much in the direction of size. While
size within reasonable limits is to be
desired and encouraged, when it is confined
to length of thigh and shank, it
is a gain of weight with but little additional
value.</p>

<h3 id='cg3' class='c017'>COLORING</h3>

<p class='c014' >The coloring of this variety is a
ground of black bronze, or shaded with
bronze. This shade is rich and glowing,
and when the sun rays are reflected
from them, they shine like polished
steel. The female is not as rich in
coloring as the male, but both have the
same color and shade. Much of its
richness and color is lost by inbreeding,
and it is improved each year with the
wild specimens. Of all our domestic
fowl, none suffer more from inbreeding
<a name='Page_127' id='Page_127'></a>than the turkey. This should be
guarded against at all times if it is
hoped to gain the best results.</p>

<div id='f126' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic012'>
<img src='images/facing126.jpg' alt='' class='ig012' />
<p>TURKEY RAISING IS AN INTERESTING AND HEALTHFUL OCCUPATION</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id='sb3' class='c017'>SELECTION OF BREEDING STOCK</h3>

<p class='c014' >Naturally the bronze turkey should
be the largest in size, the most vigorous
in constitution and the most profitable
to grow. This would be the status of
the variety at present were it not that
too little attention has been given to
the selection of the females for breeding
stock. It should be fully understood
that size and constitutional vigor
come largely from the female, and to
have this influence to the fullest extent,
well proportioned, vigorous females in
their second or third year should be
selected as breeders. Do not select
very large specimens for this purpose;
those of a medium size are usually the
best. Discard undersized females at
<a name='Page_128' id='Page_128'></a>all times, as they are of little value as
producers. Length of shank and thigh,
if out of proportion, should not be mistaken
for size. Full rounded body and
breast indicates value most clearly;
size and strength of bone indicate constitutional
vigor which should be maintained
through the selection of the very
best at all times for producing stock.</p>

<p class='c014' >When especial care is given to the
selection of breeding birds, and the
grower bears in mind those profitable
market characteristics—compactness
of form, length of breast and body, and
constitutional vigor, the most satisfactory
results may be obtained from the
growing of this variety, but no matter
how much care may be given those conditions,
only partial success will come
if inbreeding is permitted. The use
of over-sized males with small females
<a name='Page_129' id='Page_129'></a>is of less advantage than the use of
smaller males with well matured, medium
sized females.</p>

<h3 id='mr3' class='c017'>MARKETING</h3>

<p class='c014' >Of course, we cannot all sell our
turkeys for breeding. That would entirely
rob the table of its Thanksgiving
luxury. After the turkeys are grown
and ready for market, quite as much
care and attention should be given to
the killing and shipping as to the proper
growing. When these things cannot
be done to good advantage, it would be
better to sell them alive. Buyers who
are prepared to kill, dress, pack and
ship turkeys and to save the feathers,
should be in a position to pay what they
are worth alive, and should be able to
handle them at a profit better than can
the grower, who may not be prepared
to do this work to advantage. So
<a name='Page_130' id='Page_130'></a>much depends upon marketing them in
the best condition that small growers
should either dress and sell to their
home market or, providing it can be
done at a fair price, sell alive to someone
who makes a business of handling
such stock. Kill nothing but well fattened
stock. It seldom pays to sell ill-favored
stock to the market. Do not
give any feed to the turkeys for twelve
hours before killing. This allows their
crops and entrails to become empty and
avoids much of the danger of spoiling.
Full crops and entrails count against
the value; they often taint the meat,
and prevent it from being kept for any
length of time.</p>

<h3 id='dr3' class='c017'>DRESSING</h3>

<p class='c014' >Dry picking is always to be preferred
when preparing fowl for market.
When in fine condition, nicely picked,
and sent to market without having
<a name='Page_131' id='Page_131'></a>been packed in ice, the turkey is at its
best and consequently commands the
highest price. When the fowl is
plucked, hang its head down in a cool
place until all the animal heat is gone
from the body, being careful not to
hang it where it will be exposed to the
cold as it is likely to freeze. Do not remove
the head, feet or entrails, but have
the whole carcass, including the head
and feet, perfectly clean.</p>

<h3 id='sh3' class='c017'>SHIPPING</h3>

<p class='c014' >For shipping, pack as closely as possible
into close boxes or barrels, nicely
lined with white or manila paper. Do
not use brown, soiled or printed paper.
Have the package completely filled so as
to prevent the poultry from shifting.
Have all the heads laid one way, breasts
up. Do not use hay or straw for packing
as it marks and stains the fowl, detracting
<a name='Page_132' id='Page_132'></a>from the value. The above
method can only be used when the poultry
is sent to market without being
packed in ice, and when this can be done
in safety either in refrigerator cars or
for a short distance in cold weather, it
is by far the best.</p>

<p class='c014' >The greater part, however, must be
packed in ice. When necessary to do
this, use nice clean barrels, cover the
bottom with broken ice, then put in a
layer of turkey, then a layer of ice; continue
this until the barrel is packed full.
Always use perfectly clean ice for packing.
Head the barrel tightly, and mark
its contents plainly on the head.
Never ship mixed lots of poultry in the
same package if it can be avoided.</p>
